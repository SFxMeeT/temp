    <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
    <p>While front-end development is the face of a website, back-end development is the engine that keeps it running. It handles server-side logic, database management, and overall functionality. Without a strong back-end, even the most beautifully designed website would be non-functional. <br><br>The back-end is built using programming languages and frameworks that process user requests and store data securely. Some of the most widely used back-end technologies include:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><b>Python (Django, Flask):</b> Known for its simplicity and readability, often used for data-driven applications.</li>
        <li><b>PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter):</b> A popular choice for building dynamic websites and managing databases efficiently.</li>
        <li><b>Node.js (Express.js, NestJS):</b> Enables JavaScript to be used on the server side, making full-stack development more seamless.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to programming languages, databases play a crucial role in storing and managing website data. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB are common database solutions that help organize and retrieve data efficiently. <br><br>A strong back-end also ensures website security, preventing vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks and data breaches. Secure authentication, data encryption, and proper server configurations are key components of a well-built back-end system.</p>
