    <h3>Introduction to Web Programming</h3>
    <p>The internet has revolutionized the way we interact, work, and do business, making web programming an essential skill in the modern world. Web programming, often referred to as web development, involves building websites, applications, and online platforms that run on web browsers. It combines various technologies, including coding languages, frameworks, and databases, to create functional and visually appealing digital experiences. <br><br>A website is typically divided into two main parts: the front-end (what users see) and the back-end (how the website works behind the scenes). The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end relies on languages such as Python, PHP, and Node.js. A well-programmed website is not just about aesthetics; it ensures seamless navigation, fast performance, and security against potential cyber threats. <br><br>Web programming is constantly evolving, with new tools and trends emerging every year. From basic static websites to highly interactive web applications, developers play a crucial role in shaping the digital landscape. Whether you're a beginner looking to build your first website or an experienced coder diving into advanced web applications, mastering web programming opens endless opportunities in the tech industry.</p>
