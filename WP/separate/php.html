        <h3>What is PHP</h3>
        <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web pages and applications. Unlike HTML and JavaScript, which mainly handle what happens in the browser, PHP runs on the server, which means it processes data and sends the resulting content to the user's browser. PHP is used for tasks like handling form submissions, managing sessions, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic content based on user requests.<br>PHP was originally created to help developers build websites with dynamic features, and it has grown into one of the most widely used programming languages on the web. It's often used in combination with databases like MySQL to create interactive websites that can store, retrieve, and display data. For example, when you log in to a website, PHP processes your login credentials, checks them against the database, and either grants or denies access based on that data.<br>One of the key strengths of PHP is its ability to integrate seamlessly with HTML. You can mix PHP code with HTML code, which allows you to create dynamic content easily. For example, you might use PHP to retrieve the latest blog posts from a database and display them on a webpage. PHP also supports various web frameworks, such as Laravel and Symfony, which help developers build robust, scalable web applications.<br>PHP is open-source and free to use, which makes it accessible for developers around the world. It’s supported by all major web hosting providers, making it easy to deploy PHP-based websites and applications. Despite being a server-side language, PHP has a relatively simple syntax and is easy to learn for beginners, while still being powerful enough to handle complex web development tasks.<br>PHP is essential for anyone looking to dive deeper into web development, especially for building back-end services and dynamic websites. While it’s often used alongside JavaScript and HTML, PHP brings an extra layer of functionality that enables websites to do things like process payments, manage user accounts, and generate real-time data. As web development continues to grow, PHP remains an important tool in creating interactive, data-driven websites and applications.</p>
