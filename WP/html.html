        <h3>What is HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It serves as the backbone of every website, allowing developers to define how different types of content (text, images, links, videos, etc.) should be displayed on a webpage. HTML is not a programming language but rather a markup language, which means it uses special tags or "elements" to describe the structure and layout of a webpage.<br>Each HTML document is made up of elements, which are typically enclosed in angle brackets, such as <html>, <head>, and <body>. The <html> tag indicates the start of an HTML document, while the <body> tag contains the visible content of the page. Inside the body, you'll find a variety of other tags to format content. By arranging these elements, HTML gives structure and order to a webpage.<br>One of the great things about HTML is that it's incredibly easy to learn. Even if you're a complete beginner, you can start creating basic web pages in just a few hours. However, while HTML organizes content, it doesn't focus on design or interactivityâ€”that's where other technologies like CSS and JavaScript come in. HTML is a fundamental skill for anyone looking to become a web developer, and understanding it is essential to building any kind of website.<br>HTML also allows you to add links that connect pages to one another. These links, defined with the <a> tag, are what make the web so powerful, as they create a network of interconnected documents. HTML has evolved over the years, with newer versions introducing more features, such as multimedia support, forms, and improved accessibility features. Even though it has evolved, HTML remains simple and straightforward, making it a perfect starting point for anyone diving into web development.</p>
