    <h3>Web Security Best Practices</h3>
    <p>Security is one of the most critical aspects of web development. With cyber threats constantly evolving, developers must stay ahead by implementing strong security measures. A single vulnerability can compromise user data, damage a company’s reputation, and even lead to financial losses. <br><br>One of the fundamental security practices is using HTTPS, which encrypts data transfer between users and websites, preventing attackers from intercepting sensitive information. Additionally, protecting against SQL injection—where hackers manipulate database queries—is essential to safeguard user data. <br><br>Another common threat is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where malicious scripts are injected into web pages to steal user data or alter website content. To prevent this, developers should sanitize user inputs and implement Content Security Policies (CSP). <br><br>User authentication should also be a priority. Implementing secure login systems, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and proper session management can help protect accounts from unauthorized access. Secure password hashing and encryption methods should be used to store sensitive user credentials safely. <br><br>Regular security audits, software updates, and penetration testing help identify potential weaknesses before hackers exploit them. By prioritizing security, developers ensure a safe and trustworthy experience for users.</p>
