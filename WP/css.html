        <h3>What is CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a language used to style and design the appearance of web pages. While HTML provides the structure of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links, CSS controls how that content looks including its colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and overall visual presentation. Think of HTML as the foundation of a house and CSS as the paint, furniture, and decorations that make it visually appealing. CSS works by applying rules to HTML elements, where each rule consists of a selector that targets specific HTML elements and a declaration block that defines how those elements should appear. For example, if you want all the headings on your website to be blue, you would create a rule that tells the browser to display all headings in blue.<br>One of the most powerful features of CSS is its ability to control the layout of web pages. With properties like display, flexbox, and grid, developers can arrange content in columns, rows, or even complex grid systems. This makes it possible to create responsive designs that look great on both large desktop screens and small mobile devices. CSS can be added to a webpage in three ways: inline CSS, which is applied directly within an HTML element using the style attribute; internal CSS, written inside a style tag within the HTML file; and external CSS, stored in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML file, which is the most common and efficient method.<br>The term cascading in CSS refers to the way styles are applied based on priority. If multiple rules affect the same element, CSS determines which rule takes effect based on specificity, importance, and the order in which the rules appear. This helps developers manage complex stylesheets effectively. Over time, CSS has evolved with newer versions like CSS3, which introduced features such as animations, transitions, gradients, and advanced layout options. These features allow developers to create visually stunning and interactive websites without relying heavily on JavaScript or additional images. In summary, CSS is essential for making websites attractive and user-friendly. Without it, web pages would look plain and unstyled, consisting only of black text on a white background. Whether you are adjusting font sizes, creating responsive layouts, or adding smooth animations, CSS is the key to transforming basic HTML into beautiful and engaging web experiences.</p>
