    <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
    <p>Front-end development is where creativity meets functionality. It is responsible for designing the visual layout, animations, and interactive features that users engage with when they visit a website. Every button click, form submission, and dynamic content update is powered by front-end technologies.<br><br>At its core, front-end development is built upon three key technologies:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</b> The foundation of any web page, defining the structure and content, such as text, images, and links.</li>
        <li><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</b> Responsible for styling, layout, colors, and responsiveness, ensuring that a website looks great on different screen sizes.</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript:</b> Adds interactivity, such as drop-down menus, sliders, and animations, making websites more dynamic and user-friendly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Over the years, front-end development has evolved beyond basic coding. Modern frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular provide developers with efficient ways to build complex applications using reusable components. Additionally, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS simplify styling and ensure mobile responsiveness. <br><br>A well-designed front-end not only attracts users but also enhances user experience by making navigation intuitive and interactions smooth. A slow, cluttered, or outdated website can drive users away, while a polished and responsive design keeps them engaged.</p>
